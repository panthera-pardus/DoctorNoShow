# Doctor appointment "no show" report
## Date of project : Nov 2017

### Context

This report was my first project within the MSc Data Science Masters.
The report and codes were submitted in 2017.
The topic choice was open so I decided to focus on a simple task : "no show" prediction for doctors
The original data can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments

### Methods

A simple logistic regression was used here along with the corresponding data cleaning and analysis.

### Learnings

Re-visiting a report done when I started my data science journey was interesting!
With retrospect, there are many aspects of the code that seem very inefficient and clumsy - particularly the underutilisation of functions and efficient vector operations.
However, since this was a first project, this is expected :)
The methods and analysis are suitable but can be more complex to reach higher classification accuracy.
